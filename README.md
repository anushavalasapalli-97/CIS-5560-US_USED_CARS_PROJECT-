# CIS_5560_US_USED_CARS_PRICE_PREDICTION_PROJECT(Predicting the price of the USA used cars using machine learning algorithams in Databricks and Spark-Submit(Pyspark))

Using advanced Machine Learning algorithms, our project focuses on estimating used car prices and deciding whether or not a consumer is receiving a fair deal. We have used a variety of potent algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Factorization Machine Regression, Gradient Boost Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Linear Regression. Our models can precisely predict the used car's price by examining important details like the year, mileage, and number of prior owners.

We have created a comprehensive system that can offer trustworthy forecasts for customers interested in buying used cars through in-depth data analysis and model training. Our models ensure a high level of accuracy in estimating the appropriate price range by considering variousÂ elements that affect the car's value.
